# ALGO-I
#### Course assignments for Algorithms and Data Structures I

### Assignment 1: 
  - Bubble, Selection, Insertion and Shell Sorting 
  - Instrucition: allow a user to sort data from a file using Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Shell sort.
    Keep track of time by using a timer. Then find the Big O performance amongst the various sorting algorithms.

### Assignment 2:
- Merge and Quicksort
- Instructions: create a program to allow the user to sort data using merge and quicksort. Keep track of runtime using a timer.
  Then find the Big O notation and performance amongst the two types of sorting methods.

### Assignnment 3:
  - Heap and Radix Sort
  - Instructions: create a program to allow the user to sort data using merge and quicksort. Keep track of runtime using a timer.
  Then find the Big O notation and performance amongst the two types of sorting methods.

### Assignment 4:
  - Marble Game
  - Instructions: Use recursion to create a marble game where a file will be uploaded holding where walls are located, where the
    marble starts and where it needs to end up. Keep track of game state in a marbleStack and create the algorithms to check for
    walls and figure out directional moves.

### Assignment 5:
  - Jesse the Body Building Burglar
  - Instructions: Jesse is stealing gym items but can only steal one time and has a max set of weight he can carry. Each item in
    the gym has a value. Create a program that will maximize jesses carry weight as well as maximize his value in items.
    Using Hash Maps and 2-d arrays.
  - Issues in code: Did not clean up dynamic memory at the end of the program.

Assignment 6:
  - BTree
  - Instruction: Just implement BTree.
  - Issues in code: (1) Missing code that deals with only one child being added whom doesn't move, thus the parent never was set.
    (2) balance was crashing even with one node, (3) the recSave functino seemed to crash even when commenting the balance function
    out. Rotation is sometimes incorrect. Overall, needed a lot of work.
